        <h2>Economic & Political Views</h2>
        <p>Thomas Sowell's work is generally characterized by its conservative and libertarian perspectives. He is a strong advocate for free-market economics, emphasizing the importance of individual choice and limited government intervention. Sowell is known for his critiques of the concept of systemic racism as an all-encompassing explanation for disparities, and he has written extensively on the unintended consequences of policies like affirmative action and minimum wage laws, often arguing they can be detrimental to the very groups they intend to help.</p>
        <p>His writing style is noted for its clarity, directness, and reliance on empirical evidence to support his arguments. He often challenges prevailing assumptions and "politically correct" narratives across the political spectrum.</p>
